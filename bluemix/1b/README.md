# Add a new API spec and invoke an existing REST service
**Duration**: 15 mins  
**Skill level**: Beginner  

## Objective
This tutorial helps you get started quickly with **API Connect**. We'll start by creating a new OpenAPI spec, and then proxy existing REST services used by the sample weather app.

## Prerequisite
Before you begin, you will need to [set up your API Connect Instance](/bluemix/0-prereq/README.md).

### Explore the sample app and test the target endpoints
A sample _weather provider_ app was created for this tutorial.
1. To explore the app, go to http://gettingstartedweatherapp.mybluemix.net/.  
2. Enter a valid 5-digit U.S. zipcode to get the _**current weather**_ and _**today's forecast**_.  
![](images/explore-weatherapp-1.png)

  - The above sample weather app was built using APIs that provide the weather data. The endpoint to get the **current** weather data is _**https:// myweatherprovider<span></span>.mybluemix.net/current?zipcode={zipcode}**_.
  - Test it out by going to https://myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net/current?zipcode=90210.  
  ![](images/explore-weatherapp-2.png)

  - Similarly, the Endpoint to get **today's** forecast data is _**https:// myweatherprovider<span></span>.mybluemix.net/today?zipcode={zipcode}**_.
  - Test it out by going to https://myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net/today?zipcode=90210.

### Add a new OpenAPI spec and invoke an existing REST service
1. Log in to IBM Bluemix: https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/login.
2. In the Bluemix navigation panel, select **Services**, then select **Dashboard**. Launch the API Connect service.
3. In API Connect, make sure the navigation panel is open. If not, click **>>** to open it.  
4. Select **Drafts** in the navigation panel.
5. Select the **APIs** tab and select **Add**. From the dropdown menu, select **New API**.    
  ![](images/create-new-1.png)  
4. In the *New API* window, enter ```Weather Provider API``` for the title.
_The Name and Base Path are auto-populated_.  
5. Select **Create API** to complete the wizard.  
6. After you create your API, the **Design** tab is selected. 
- Scroll to the **Host** panel. Note the value that's filled in: ```$(catalog.host)```.  
- In the **Base Path** panel, note the auto-populated value: ```/weather-provider-api```.  

Your API's target URL will be created from these values.  

7. Scroll to the **Security** tab, and delete the "clientIDHeader (API Key)" that has been been auto-generated.  
_(We'll visit security with API Keys in the next tutorial.)_  

8. In the side navigation panel, scroll down to the **Paths** panel.   
    a. Create a new path by clicking **+**.   
    b. Name the new path "**/current**".  
    c. In the same *Paths* panel, select the **GET /current** section.    
    d. In the **GET /current** section, add a new **Parameter**.   
      - Name: zipcode  
      - Located in: Query  
      - Required: Yes (check mark)  
      - Type: string   
    ![](images/path-current-1.png)   
    e. Save your API.  

9. In the navigation panel, scroll down to the **Definitions** panel.   
    a. Add a new definition  
    b. Name the new definition _Current_,  
    c. Set the Type to _Object_  
    d. Add new properties for the **Current** definition.    
       - Name: zip         /  Type: string   
       - Name: temperature /  Type: integer   
       - Name: humidity    /  Type: integer   
       - Name: city        /  Type: string   
       - Name: state       /  Type: string   
    ![](images/definition-current-1.png)   
    e. Save your API.  

10. In the left side-navigation panel, scroll back up to the **Paths** panel.
  a. Open the **GET /current** operation, and scroll to the **Responses** section.
  b. Change the schema of the 200OK response from "object" to "**Current**".
  c. Save your API.
The path and operation you created was to get the current weather data. Next, you'll need to create a similar path and operation to get today's weather data.  

11. Similar to how you created the **/current** path in step 8, create a new path: **/today**.
12. Add a new Parameter under the **GET /today** operation.
    - Parameter Name: zipcode
    - Located in: Query
    - Required: Yes (check mark)
    - Type: string  

13. Create a new definition: **Today**.
14. Add new properties for the **Today** definition.
    - Name: zip / Type: string
    - Name: hi / Type: integer
    - Name: lo / Type: integer
    - Name: nightHumidity / Type: integer
    - Name: dayHumidity / Type: integer
    - Name: city / Type: string
    - Name: state / Type: string
15. Update the response schema in the **GET /today** section to "Today".
16. Save your API.

17. Switch over to the **Assemble** tab. You've got two operations so far: **GET /current** and **GET /today**. To ensure the correct target endpoint is invoked, you'll need to create some logic that will execute conditional on the operation that's being called. Let's use the **Operation Switch** logic construct to do this.  
    a. Delete the **invoke** policy that may already be added to the _canvas_.  
    b. From the palette, drag the **Operation Switch** and drop it on the canvas.  
        - To **case 0**, assign the **get /current** operation.
        - Add a new Case: **case 1**.
        - Assign the **get /today** operation to **case 1**.
       ![](images/assemble-1.png)
The **Operation Switch** provides a decision point. Based on the verb/path pair, the appropriate operation needs to be invoked.

    c. Drag the **invoke** policy from the palette and drop it on the canvas. _The invoke action is used to call an existing service from within an operation_.  
        - Drop an invoke action in the **/get current** path, and one in the **/get today** path.   
        - Select the **invoke** policy in the **/get current** path, and update its title to "**invoke-current**".  
        - Update the URL field with https://myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net/current?zipcode=$(request.parameters.zipcode).  
        - Select the **invoke** policy in the **/get today** path, and update its title to "**invoke-today**".  
        - Update the URL field with https://myweatherprovider.mybluemix.net/today?zipcode=$(request.parameters.zipcode).  
        ![](images/assemble-2.png)

18. Save your API.

### Test your API proxy
1. In the **Assemble** tab, select **More Actions > Generate a default product**.  
   ![](/bluemix/1a/images/generate-default-product-1.png) 

2. Accept the default options in the **New Product** dialog box, and select **Create Product**. The Weather Provider API product is created and published to the Sandbox catalog. A message indicating successful product generation is displayed.  
  ![](/bluemix/1a/images/generate-default-product-2.png)  
  
  ![](/bluemix/1a/images/generate-default-product-3.png) 

  - _In API Connect, **Products** provide a way to group APIs that are intended for a particular use. Products are published to a **Catalog**. [Reference: API Connect glossary]_

3. Save and click â–º to test the API service.
4. Choose the newly created default product and the **get /current** operation.  
  - Zipcode is a required parameter for this operation, so enter a valid U.S. zipcode (for example, 90210).  
  - Click **invoke**, and verify that you see:
  ```
  200 OK response
  Current weather data for 90210  
  ```

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, you created a new OpenAPI spec and proxied existing REST services used by the sample weather app.
